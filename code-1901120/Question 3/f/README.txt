The python program implements the attack in question 3(e)
It should be run using 'Python3 cfb_attack.py -h' to get instructions

IMPORTANT:
The file must have the cfb coursework binary in the same file to work, if it is run in my code archive as submitted this should work fine. This binary is the one Francois uploaded to teams.

DEPENDENCIES:
subprocess (Should be installed by default but if not: pip3 install subprocess)
argparse (Should be installed by default but if not: pip3 install subprocess)
sys (Should definitely be installed by default)
